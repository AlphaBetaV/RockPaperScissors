# RockPaperScissors
Console game of Rock Paper Scissors

Built an interative solution to performing a console version of rock paper scissors.

Focused first on creating a single game where the computer's choice was randomized between a choice of rock, paper, or scissors. I then focused on making sure that an alert was given if the player picked a choice that was not 1 of the 3 options.

I then worked on comparing the two hands, logging what options each actor performed and then notated the result of the game. Then I added variables to keep track of the score of the game.

The last element that I worked on was integrating my code into a loop for 5 games where the player is prompted for a choice. After the player chooses, the game commences, winner/loser/ties are declared the total score is saved with the winner being announced at the end.

If I come back to this project, I would add a while loop to keep prompting the user for a valid choice if they type something other than "rock, paper or scissors". Right now, there is no way to re-prompt the user while staying on the same game #.
